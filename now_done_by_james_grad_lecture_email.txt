Dear PreDocs,

This is a reminder to us that we are due to attend the Graduate Lecture series
today. 

Today's presenter: foo
Today's topic: bar

If you cannot make it for a good reason, please send your apologies to Annabel
<as11@sanger.ac.uk> or Christina <chd@sanger.ac.uk> (which I think only
concerns people from Sanger Institute. If you are an EBI one - do not e-mail
Annabel or Christina, unless you want to be funny).

thank you,
The Ghost of Sergei's crontab
