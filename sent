Dear Attendees,

This is a reminder to us that we are due to attend the PhD journal club in one
hour (at 16:00) in  James Watson Pavilion today. Please don't forget to get hold of the paper and read it
over this one hour which is left if you still haven't done so.

Today's presenter: Carmen Diaz Soria

If you cannot make it for a good reason, please send your apologies to Annabel
<as11@sanger.ac.uk> or Christina <chd@sanger.ac.uk> (which I think only

Dear Attendees,

Dear Attendees,

This is a reminder to us that we are due to attend the PhD journal club in one
hour (at 16:00). Please don't forget to get hold of the paper and read it
over this one hour which is left if you still haven't done so.

Today's presenter: Kaur Alasoo
Today's chair: Sophia David

Next up: Tarjinder Singh chaired by Konstantinos Tzelepis

If you cannot make it for a good reason, please send your apologies to Annabel
<as11@sanger.ac.uk> or Christina <chd@sanger.ac.uk> (which I think only
concerns people from Sanger Institute. If you are an EBI one - do not e-mail
Annabel or Christina, unless you want to be funny).
