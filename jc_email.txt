Dear Attendees,

This is a reminder to us that we are due to attend the PhD journal club in one
hour (at 16:00). Please don't forget to get hold of the paper and read it
over this one hour which is left if you still haven't done so.

Today's presenter: foo
Today's chair: bar

Next up: unique chaired by term

If you cannot make it for a good reason, please send your apologies to Annabel
<as11@sanger.ac.uk> or Christina <chd@sanger.ac.uk> (which I think only
concerns people from Sanger Institute. If you are an EBI one - do not e-mail
Annabel or Christina, unless you want to be funny).

thank you,
The Ghost of Sergei's crontab
